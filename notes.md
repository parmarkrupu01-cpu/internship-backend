# What is MVC
MVC stands for Model View Controller.
The Model handles the database.
The Controller contains the application logic.
The View displays the output to the user.

## What is API
An API is used for communication between the frontend and backend.
An API returns only data, usually in JSON format.

## Real Life Example: Login Form
The user enters an email and password.
The form data is sent to the server.
The server checks the data in the database.
A success or error response is sent back to the user.
